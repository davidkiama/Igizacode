                        tunameza zile makali zetu,bash iliendelea poa mizoga zilikuwa kwa wingi,
                        intention zetu hazikuwa kulala uko, tulikuwa ikifika masaa ya wazito tujitoe 
                        tuende kejani juu tulikuwa na plan ya kunguru mbili sisters halafu tulikuwa 
                        na kibuyu ya ratish na gilbeys iko pending home, so tulijuwa kukamuana iko 
                        guaranteed whole night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sasa host wetu alikuwa anitwa ted keja ilikuwa zimmer, mizoga mob uko ilikuwa 
                        na curfew sasa ni uchape kiswahili uchukuwe number utahall siku ingine.
                        Bahati mbaya ama nzuri mvua ilianza, apo tu tunajibamba na mziki na kudance na mizoga..
                        Tuka anza ile game ya truth or dare ya kuspin the bottle, mtu ana ambiwa afanye upuzi 
                        kama kutoa shirt kukiss mzoga bla bla za walevi
                        it was a good day indeed, mafala wengine mabeste wa ted walikuwa wamebleki kwa kiti 
                        na wengine kutapika kwa bafu..
                        tuliendelea vizuri na mizoga mob zika anza kupigiwa simu na mama zao, so wengi walijitoa 
                        na iyo mvua, hadi ule mzoga nilikuwa na katia iyo siku.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mvua nayo iliendelea kunyesha tu, mizoga zilibaki few na keja imebaki na ndume mingi 
                        though zingine zimelala things ziliharibika stima ilipopotea, keja ikanyamaza, 
                        ted naye alikuwa na candles mbili pekee...tuliendelea kukunywa hoping stima zitarudi
                        mziki tunaskiza na phone apo kwa giza unajaribu kuguza matiti uone mzoga kama itaresist ..
                        Tuliendelea na ted akatushow iyo bedroom kuna double decker watu wanne wanaweza lala uko 
                        na wengine kwa kiti... yeye akaenda na mzoga yake bedroom
                        halafu akarudi badayee akafunga mlango na padlock akadai mtu akitakaa kutoka ataniamsha.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Edu na mzoga walikuwa nayo wakaenda bedroom kwa bed ya juu na mulika mwizi
                        mimi naye nikashow iyo kunguru niliguza matiti si tuende pia iyo bed moja isichukuliwe, 
                        ikakubali tukaenda...simu yangu ilikuwa 10% charge
                        tukaenda tukajiseti kitanda ya chini na tukafunga mlango,
                        Edu ata dakika kumi azikuisha ashanza kugurumisha mzoga,halafu to make things worse kunguru

                <h3 class="story__title">Guests Of Shame</h3>
                <p class="story__story">
                    <p>
                        A friend requested me to accompany him to his mother-in-law to pay something called 
                        "Ayie". So the two of us set off, picked two other guys in the village and headed straight 
                        to Kendu Bay. We got there by five thirty jioni, booked into Big5(a very good restaurant), 
                        to refresh and eat something before getting to the MIL by seven.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We took light food, sisi watu wa town we don't each much. The two guys we picked from the 
                        village demanded full blown supper, which they got even though we tried telling them there 
                        was plenty of food where we were going.
                        " We know!" They chorused. Ok.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We arrived after seven, of course the wife had come to collect us coz we didn't know the excact home.
                        Maombi, then the whole family streaming in to greet us and see their In-laws.
                        Immediately after that, meza zikaanza kupangwa, food tayari. Chai, bread, nduma, viazi, njugu, chapos, 
                        maharagwe, mandazi, mchele, mihogo. By just seeing them, I was already full.
                        I settled for what I don't normally eat in town, nduma viazi and my friend too. One cup of tea then I was ok.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wacha hawa majamaa wengine wavamie hii food. Chapo zilikunjwa, I never thought somebody could eat 
                        five home made chapos with beans, full plate of buttered bread na mandazi kadhaa.
                        Mpaka najaribu kukanyaga miguu ya wadhii chini ya meza waache ujinga, nobody seemed to care and 
                        imagine tulipewa two beauties watuserve. If they could have not been there, I could have 
                        slapped the lights out of those bastards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One was complaining that tumepewa vikombe ndogo za chai, inafanya mtu aongeze chai mara mingi 
                        na kumbe hakuna hata kitu amekunywa. In short alikuwa anataka mug.
                        Madame waliongeza chai mpaka wakaanza tu ku giggle.
                        So jamaa mmoja akachukua initiative ajiongeze chai mwenyewe.
                        He lifted the kettle with force thinking it was heavy, kumbe it was empty and the dude ended up 
                        losing balance and crashing a few plates. I just felt sick!
                        So chai iliisha, majamaa wakabaki na njugu kwa mikono(both hands) wakirusha moja moja, sweating 
                        like fools. They were in suits and behaving like this, ndio mana suvai suits, I can't share 
                        that look with uncouth individuals like those guys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two hours later, the table was set again, this time it was supper. Fish, chicken, meat, chapo 
                        tena, wali na ile sima ya sifted flour na greens kila aina. Home watu hawajazoea sifted flour 
                        so you can imagine the damage.
                        In my mind I thought since walishakula vile, watakuwa wameshiba. I was in for a rude shock.
                        These two hours between meals, guys had got out for fresh air, I don't know whether they 
                        induced vomit ama walienda tu wakapunguza weight vizuri(kunia) expecting another meal. I can't tell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was too embarrassed to eat. The two of us just sat watching with few helpings. The table was set 
                        in a way that we faced each other, two on both sides. After the girls had served us, they retreated 
                        to their corner to let us eat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was very surprised to hear one guy whispering to the other amsaidie na pilipili yet there was no 
                        pepper on the table. Kumbe, one of them had it inside his coat pocket. Akachomoa kadhaa wakagawana 
                        na wakaanza kukula. They always walked with peppers whenever they travelled.
                        I don't know whether am exaggerating or I had never met such people.
                        Guys were cracking chicken bones like no one's business and soup flowing between their fingers into 
                        their arms. They would lick the backs of their hands and pull the coats' sleeves to lick further down. 
                        Hapana tambua serviette!
                        One even dipped his tie into a bowl of soup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When this torture was over, guys turned the plates so that the side they were working on, faced us, 
                        ndio ionekane ni sisi ndio tumekula. After this, soda zikaletwa na madem sasa, to keep their s
                        hemejis busy tusiboeke with some music.
                        The following day ndio tulikuwa sasa tuonane na MiL.
                        Our morale was so low coz nobody would understand that these idiots were hired to help us in negotiations. 
                        They had no dignity to uphold or a reputation to safeguard, furthermore there was no blood relationship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we sat there thinking of measures of curbing any further damage, fools were already cuddling girls 
                        for coitus, zero chills.
                        Am never attending any ceremony with strangers any time soon.

                <h3 class="story__title">Mr Gustavo</h3>
                <p class="story__story">
                    <p>
                        Sometime back, I met one Mr. Gustavo on Facebook. Mmmh! Mr. Yellow. Damn! He is Italian. 
                        What else do I ask God for? I clicked on 'Confirm' button to accept his friend request. 
                        Then headed straight to his inbox. ' Hi, Thanks for the add ' and the chats started till 
                        3 am in the morning. Day and Night. No sleeping at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Gustavo owns a Beach Resort in Watumu. He tells me he is 34 years old. What a young 
                        wealthy man. His English is not so good, he says he has been in Kenya for a year and now 
                        he has enrolled for English classes. I believe his story, and besides, I do not expect him 
                        to know English, he is Italian. So his broken English is fine. I am in love.
                        We date online for 6 weeks and he invites me to Watamu. Mimi ni nani? Mimi Waiguress, 
                        When it comes to traveling and more so to the beach, nothing stops me. As if that is not 
                        enough , this trip has an added bonus. Mr. Gustavo. The love of my life. So why not? 
                        The dare devil in me lead me into temptations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I quickly broke the good news to my girls. You see Mr. Gustavo and I have already planned 
                        a wedding and these girls are to be my brides maids. Wow! They just marveled at me with 
                        admirations. But I can't tell them that Mr. Gustavo and I haven't met before. We plan a 
                        trip to Watamu within 3 days. I mean! Jambojet gets you there faster. 3 of my girlfriends 
                        tag along. The other 2 can't travel within a short period of time.
                        Upon arrival at Malindi airport, Mr. Gustavo sends me a message, he is held up so we can 
                        only meet the following day. That's ok. We head to Turtle Bay Villas. Book ourselves in. 
                        Get a chef and chauffeur. Took selfies and photos and pasted them all over social media. 
                        Painted Watamu red. You just need to see the excitement I carry myself in when I am traveling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following day we prepare ourselves and head out to meet my love. The husband be in his 
                        Beach Resort Hotel. We meet the receptionist and she tells us that Mr. Gustavo is in a 
                        meeting with the Italian Ambassador in Kenya. And for sure the envoys car is parked 
                        outside. We are ushered in his launch to wait for him. The hotel offers us some cold 
                        beverage. We decide to sit outside and enjoy the sea breeze.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The meeting is over and the receptionist walks a gentleman towards us. They are accompanied 
                        by another lady.\My girls are now anxious and they start asking if the dude arriving is the 
                        'one' and of course yes. According to his Facebook profile picture. Yes he is the one. I 
                        stand up to give him a hug! Smiling, Calling out, 'oh babe!' Just the same way we have 
                        been calling each other on Facebook messenger and Whatsapp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shock on Me! Mr. Gustavo steps back! And asks me ,<br>
                        Do I know you? Have we met before? My heart skips a beat. But he is the same one I have dated 
                        for 6 weeks ! I try and introduce myself, introduced my girls too who are calmly watching the 
                        drama as it unfolds. Mr. Gustavo does not get it. The receptionist looks confused. The lady 
                        who had accompanied them speaks in Italian and they stare at us in disbelief. I'm now sweating. 
                        My heart is racing, not beating, It's confusing, I can't see well. Mr. Gustavo calls the 
                        security guys. I look at my girls and they are confused and Wondering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I try and explain myself to the security guys and somehow they want to see the chats. I 
                        show them. I even give them Mr. Gustavo's phone number. The number we have been chatting 
                        on Whatsapp. One of the security guys dials the number and recognises its owener. He smiles. 
                        He speaks to Mr. Gustavo in Italian. And Mr. Gustavo leaves us with the security men. We are 
                        lead down to the beach. To meet the person I have been chatting with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The security man calls him on phone and tells him to come over with 'MADAFU' 4 of them, for 
                        some clients in the hotel.Then, BOOM! a beach boy shows up carrying madafu.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MY GUSTAVO!!<br>
                        I have been chatting with a beach boy! My blood freezes in my veins.
                        Slowly I come back to my senses, Pseudo Facebook account! I turn around and look at my girls, 
                        They stare at My Gustavo!I stare at My Gustavo with my mouth wide open!

                        The year 1988,Tues afternoon a bouncing baby girl was born at Pumwani maternity hospital,
                        born premature,had to stay in the incubator for 3 months,most doctors and nurses thought 
                        I would not make it,but I did. Fast forward,my mum was a single mom,never knew what a 
                        father figure looked like.I can remember we used to live in dandora.my mum was a secretary,
                        so we used to manage.when I was 3years old she used to leave me at night n only God knows 
                        where she used to go but nikiuliza swali nilikuwa napewa kichapo Cha mbwa.sometimes she 
                        used to lock me in the house and go for days,I used to cry Hadi neighbors walikuwa wameshazoea.
                        I remember one day landlady alivunja mlango akanichukua tukaenda kwake but when mum came 
                        alikasirika Sana saying namwaibisha.i was beaten kichapo ingine noma.Anyway life continued 
                        hivyo hivyo Hadi I learned kunyamaza,sit kwa nyumba until ile siku atarudi.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I turned four years,one Saturday morning she told me leo nakupeleka out plus nikupeleke 
                        you get your ears pierced,sisi hao Hadi town.i got my ears pierced was taken out for lunch then 
                        she told me nataka we go visit aunty Grace(not her real name)I was happy coz aunty Grace was a 
                        rich lady n I liked visiting her place coz of the goodies n attention I got there.
                        So around 3pm we were at my aunt's place,I got to play with my cousins of course the goodies 
                        were there too Kama kawaida.That night went spent the night there and everything seemed okay 
                        to me.Although my mum n aunt had very long private conversation in their language so my cousins 
                        and I didn't bother listening since we couldn't understand what they were talking about,we just 
                        went on with our games huko nje.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3 days later we were still at my aunt's place,I didn't get worried coz mum carried a bag full of 
                        clothes but I did not understand why, didn't ask myself maswali coz you know that worked out for 
                        me just fine.i mean I was away from our ka single room,I had people around me so I was like wtf 
                        let me tumia this time that Niko free kucheza before nirudi jela.On the 4 day afternoon mum was 
                        making Chapo,she used to make very good chapoz and all her relatives used to call her to make them 
                        ndio they stock them up kwa fridge but that was also her signature move of saying goodbye.so 
                        I knew kesho morning tunarudi kwetu.I slept sad that night, didn't also ask her ndio nisichapwe.
                        mungu alinifunza kunyamaza The following day I woke up Kama kawaida n mum was not in the guest 
                        wing,so I thought labda Yuko loo.I didn't bother checking,I just sat in bed waiting for her,Her 
                        bed had no beddings so I also thought labda anafua sheets za wenyewe before we leave,1hr later 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided wacha nikamwangalie did not see her,went to the main house asked the house boy and he 
                        told me"mamako alienda job"I kept wondering how could my mum just up n leave bila hata kuniambia 
                        but anyway Kama Ni job for sure atarudi kunichukua jioni twende home....nothing a week turned 
                        into a month and a month into a year my mum never returned to pick me up.i never saw her again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I was 6yrs,Aunty Grace had a best friend who suggested that I should be taken to nyeri to 
                        live with her mum because the mum was old n lonely.she insisted that I would be very good company 
                        for the mom.what choice did I have??none.one weekend the trip was planned n executed.in a few 
                        hours we were in nyeri,the old lady lived large.she didn't seem bad at first infact she was very friendly to me.
                        She had prepared lunch,so tukakula,some catching up for her n the daughter,stories hapa na pale,she was even 
                        given upkeep cash n my fees anipeleke shule.

                    <p>
                        Dem anakwama kwa mansion, kumbe hata nyumba si yako… umeomba tu upigie 
                        one night stand. THREAD. Kuna time nimejiweka kwa long distance re-lotion-ship 
                        like the weak nigga I am coz nabii hakubaliki kwao... Kazi ni kuchukua sheria 
                        mikononi mwangu like a certified vigilante. Kila kitu ilikuwa inaenda fine 
                        until ile siku dem alidai anakuja mtaani kuniona. Nikajua kitumbua kimeingia 
                        mchanga haikuwa setbook pekee
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wahenga walidai fimbo ya mbali haiui nyoka lakini kulingana na vile tulikuwa 
                        tumechochana kwa chat, nikajua hapa lazma nyoka itoke pangoni na iwekwe 
                        mpangoni? Shida ya short distance relationship mdem hushinda ame pop up kwa 
                        mansion yako kama adverts za YouTube, huwezi enjoy… mraiya nikaamua away games 
                        ndio inaweza. Dem hawezi vuka hizo county zote more than five including ku risk 
                        kupitia Salga kuja tu kukuliwa na kunguni, lazima akuwe kwa menu pia. Si mraiya 
                        nikaenda kuomba arif yangu keja ya kuchafulia mechi coz kuna venye yangu 
                        ilikuwa disorganized kama disconnecting beards. Socks hazikuwa na unity, 
                        unapata socks moja iko RIGHT where it's supposed to be but ingine ime LEFT, 
                        unabaki na ya kushoto unaskia kulia 😩. In short, nguo zilikuwa kila mahali 
                        kama network ya Safaricom. After ku organize venue ikabaki guest of honour 
                        kufika, mi ka host nilikua nishajipanga programme… anafika namfikisha kibanda 
                        akakule alafu arudi venue nimkule 😏
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Dem akafika tukaenda kuchangamkia chapo ndengu hapo kibanda ishikilie tumbo, 
                        angetaka kushiba angetoka kwao kama amekula. After lunch tuka rudi mansion, 
                        alafu ni ile na avoid majirani wa arif kuniona… unaeza meet nao ukikula 
                        ambience uskie wamekuita “Msee wa kuomba keja” wakuchomee picha bure. 
                        After pleasantries ilikuwa kuangaliana nikama tuko news room tunangoja 
                        kuambiwa ni saa moja tuanze kusoma news, hapa ndio unaachia laws of 
                        attraction zifanye kazi yake… akakaribia nikamkaribia
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Ningeenda straight tu the point but nikama alikuwa anadaisha foreplay 
                        kwanza, ni wale madem wa let’s take it slow… ooh let nature take it’s course kosokoso
                        Foreplay ni kama kuenda base ya mutura upate bado haijaiva uanze kulamba chumvi 
                        ukingoja, ama kuenda kibanda kununua chipo upate hazijaiva uanze kulamba 
                        tomatoe sauce… but si ni life! Umewai kuwa dryspell for long hadi ukipata 
                        opportunity ya kupeana mate unapeana nikama CPR ama mouth to mouth resasitation? 
                        Una kiss ni kama una syphon mafuta kwa caburator… tuka exchange saliva kama foreign currency.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Juu hiyo mansion ilikuwa na giza kama Egypt, njaro ilikuwa kusoma braille 
                        kama kipofu, yaani kucheza na nipples.. Unacheza nazo ni kama unafungua 
                        kifuniko ya colget 😭😭
                        Nika choka kucheza na chakula ya watoto nika teremka kusini kutafta kisima 
                        nikate kiu. Nikacheza kama gynecologist, miguu zika spread kwa sheet kama 
                        Excel ndio ni Access birth canal 😏
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Juu miguu zilikuwa zime spread kama injili next ilikuwa missionary work... 
                        Her body was the temple and I was a sinner so nikaingia 😩
                        Ilikuwa kicheni Twa Twa... Garine... Lakini hatukuwa na gari.. So ghafla bin 
                        fu, dem kupigwa na butwa Twa Twa... Tulikuwa tumemaliza session and I 
                        cum to my senses. Mansion ilikuwa inakaa Gikomba market, nguo zilikuwa 
                        kila mahali, panty kwa tv, bra imehung kwa ceiling kama chandelier, boxer 
                        kwa sufuria, blouse sijui ilifika aje mlango ika maintain ka door mat. Si 
                        nikajua hii date imeisha hivyo, ni kupumzika tu kidogo alafu kila mtu aende zake… 
                        tuka rest kitu thate minutes hivi nikaamsha dem tujitoe coz main agenda ilikuwa 
                        imeisha. Dem akadai mi niende nitampata tu kwa keja, nikamuuliza kama haendi 
                        kwa aunty yake akadai alitumia tu hiyo excuse ndio apewe chance ya kuja 
                        mtaani but haoni akienda huko anytime soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Hapo ndio mans nikajua things fall apart, hii ilifaa kuwa hit and run 
                        si hit and learn… kwa wenyewe kwanza. Dem alikuwa amejianika kwa wenyewe 
                        kama paka ya duka akidhani ako kwangu 😩

                        Nikamsho ntakuja tuonge, acha niende niombe ruhusa job kwanza… nikafika 
                        idlers corner ku meet arif kumshow vile situation iko, akadai nimpee key 
                        ya kwangu alafu mimi nirudi ni sort hiyo mess nimewacha kwake
                        Kurudi mansion Napata womans ametoa nguo za arif zile chafu nje anazifua, 
                        nikajua baas huyu nikama hajakuja mchezo, amekuja Nairobi kuishi, kuingia kejani 
                        ilikuwa ashaosha sufuria zilikuwa chafu pia.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Nikama shida ikikupata huwa inaita shida zingine meeting kwako, dem akaingia mansion 
                        ka amebeba bra kadhaa na amejam, akazitupa kwa meza akiuliza ni za nani? Hapa ndio 
                        waKisii hudai “Hoveee suspense!!!”

                        Mtoto wa mtu angejua tuko kwa wenyewe, nguo anafua ni za wenyewe, hizo bra 
                        zinampandisha pressure ni za wenyewe… hata hangekuwa ananisumbua hivi na 
                        maswali ya kipuzi. But nika maintain nisishushe gangster points. Si ikabidi 
                        nimchapie kuna arif nilikuwa nimemsaidia keja last week na nikama manzi yake 
                        aliwacha hizo staff hapo… dem akadai niache kumpima ni kama ako kwa weighing 
                        scale, akadai hiyo ndio reason hatoki huku haraka.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Dem akaenda kuchoma bra za wenyewe huko nje na dress na blouse, nilikuwa 
                        hapo sijui nicheke ama nijam coz mwenye nyumba naye atanimaliza… but my 
                        toxic masculinity wouldn't let me rat on myself. Si mdem aka maintain 
                        nikama ako kwake though alikuwa amefura nikama KDF imekulishwa yeast, 
                        mimi saa hiyo najaribu kupiga hesabu ya minus coz tulikuwa tumedunga hema.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Nikajua hapa lazma nicheze reverse psychology, una agree na kile anasema 
                        alafu akidhani muko highway moja anajikuta kwa highway ya kuenda Eritrea 
                        wewe ukielekea Thika. Nikamchapia haitakuwa poa aseme ocha anakuja kuona 
                        aunty yake alafu waskie hajawai kanyaga huko, atleast aende awagote hata

                        day then atarudi jioni, nikampatia fare ya kuenda na kurudi… cha muhimu 
                        ilikuwa atoke mwenyewe bila forceful eviction
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Dem akafika akanitext “Nimefika poa” hapo nikajua baas nimejiondoa kwa mess, 
                        nikamtext kumsho anaeza maintain huko coz kuna venye uncle yangu amekuja 
                        mtaani kufuata pesa zake za NSSF na itabidi ame crush kwangu mwezi moja.

                        Ethics tuna dance Rekles kwa floor. Tuli make sure zimetushika na timebaki 
                        Zzero. Mraiya wengine walikuwa wameanzisha Kericho tea factory kulingana na 
                        vile walikuwa juu ya majani… walikuwa wanachana hadi lips zika turn green 
                        ni kama wamejipaka lipstick ya green. Nikajua nikizuba kiasi dem ataamka 
                        kesho yake kwa “New ceiling, who dis?”… nika okoa jahazi juu dem alikuwa 
                        maji na mafisi wanaeza amua kuzamisha miti zao kwake ka submarine. Huku 
                        nje ni kubaya juu “Asiye funzwa na mamaye hufunzwa huanguka mtihani anapewa 
                        D na wanaume”… unaeza kata maji u-chew blackout upate unapigwa maji! Shida 
                        ya kujaribu ku control mtu amelewa ni kama kuzuiya mshuto… si posbo. Dem 
                        alikuwa anajianika kama nguo za soko, mikono zake zilikuwa all over me kama 
                        marashi ya Binti Sudan. Dem alikuwa ratchet ka fwacken, nikakazana kumtoa 
                        dancefloor but juu ya ulevi akagusa mali ya arif flani alikuwa amezuba, nikaskia 
                        amemwambie “Si ukunywe kahawa iamke.”
                    </p>

                        Kidogo kidogo akachomea mans vile ako na inches ndogo kama misumari ya ceiling. 
                        Lol! Inches mwanaume ata-compensate kwa vitu ka TV na simu. Nikaendea arif 
                        mwenye alikuwa ana host hiyo house party anitaftie room coz kuna venye huyo 
                        dem alikuwa anachoma picha… akadai room yake haiko occupied naeza mpeleka huko. 
                        Dem alikuwa maji nikajua nikimwacha peke yake anaeza fanyiwa plumbing services 
                        apigwe pipe, so nlikuwa na yeye hapa kwa hapa kama wasee wa JKUAT na kunguni.

                        Umewai pigwa mate na mtu amekunywa pombe ya 45% alcohol content? Shit ni 
                        illicit hadi minyoo zililewa instantly. Alikuwa anapumua fumes ziko highly 
                        flammable, nikamwambia No means No. Aka sneak mkono kwa boxer yangu akaanza 
                        kucheza na inches kama ruler… as much as ningetaka tuteremshane nikajiuliza, 
                        huyu dem sijawai hit akiwa sober so why now? Nikajua hii ni pombe. Dem alikuwa 
                        amekata maji kama kanjo and she wants to tap that... But juu mimi ni msee 
                        hydrophobic na sipendi vitu ziko maji, nika turn down the offer like a real man ??

                        Kupiga maji mali iko maji ni kama rape case according to goal line technology 
                        juu hiyo mali iko under the influence so sikutaka ku risk… kitu unafaa kula 
                        ikiwa maji ni watermelon, cabbage ama mashakura. Hiyo siku ndio nilijua walevi 
                        na KPLC hukuwa kwa periodic table moja, wote hutegemea maji na wakikata maji 
                        wote hu blackout… after kunisumbua dem finally ali-chew blackout. Akachukua ma 
                        positions za ukuta akajikunja akalala, nika meditate kando yake kiasi kupima 
                        radar kama ni kulala amelala ama ni kukula vako… after kukaa macho 2hr nika 
                        confirmed ni usingizi! Time nimeshikwa na usingizi wa porno naota Lupita Nyong’o 
                        akinishow my dreams are valid nikazigeuza wet dreams… nikaskia kitu moto alafu wet 
                        inanichoma choma nikajua ndoto zinatimizwa mahali. Kumbe niki experience wet dreams, 
                        dem naye alikuwa amelala usingizi wa pono but badala ya wet dreams aka-wet bed… 
                        technically tuli exchange body fluids coz mkojo yake ilipita jeans na boxer yangu.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Alafu juu matress ya arif ilikuwa imeisha ka foolscap, mkojo ilikuwa imepita hadi 
                        side B ya matress ikaacha river Mississippi iki meander kwa floor ni kama ilikuwa 
                        inatafta vile itajipeleka choo yenyewe. Alafu kumbe ammonium huwa viscous ka shit 
                        coz iligeuka vapour ika fill hiyo room… kwa wale hamjui rusungu namaanisha hiyo 
                        room ikaanza kunuka mkojo. Na vile ya mtu mkubwa hutupa! Kuangalia watch, ilikuwa 
                        4:20 na kulikuwa na harufu ya weed kwa hewa, nika tippy toe hadi sitting room nikapata 
                        ni wasee wa kuchana jaba walikuwa bado wanashindana na giza kukesha. Nikajua hatuwezi 
                        ngoja hadi mchana ndio tuchomoke, tutapita aje watu asubuhi tukinuka ammonium?
                    </p>
                    <p> 

                        Alafu 
                        hiyo aibu ya ku-face arif… ni heri tutembeze viatu then kesi baadaye. Dem bado 
                        alikuwa na ma hang downs despite the fact that alikuwa amejiosha na mkojo proper… 
                        inafaa waache kusema Don’t drink and drive waanze kusema Don’t drink and dive coz 
                        alikuwa ameloa mkojo. Tuka tippy toe tukachomoka na hiyo giza na baridi ya asubuhi, 
                        tukatembea side by side ka choo za Gents na Ladies coz tulikuwa tunanuka urinals… 
                        kitu ilikuwa ina miss tu ni inzi tukae kama choo za kanjo. Enyewe pombe si maji… 
                        haimaanishi vile Yesu alibadilisha maji kuwa pombe ati pombe ni maji! Inaitwa gauge 
                        lakini pia unafaa kuji gauge! If it’s a must that you drink, kunywa ukuwe maji 
                        psychologically si ukunywe hadi ukuwe maji physically pia… Kunywa na adabu ama 
                        utashikwa na adabu!!!
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        DRINK responsibly or responsibilities will follow you afterwards. Alafu 
                        ambieni haters sikunywangi Whitecap, so niko na time ya ku "waist" kwa hii 
                        App... I'm still here ?? ??

                    <p>
                        Hio siku niliingia kwa yard in very high spirits, was looking 
                        forward to an exciting day ahead, driving a Merc c230 Kompressor 
                        all the way to Nai na slices zilikua zanigojea huko. In greek a 
                        Mercedes is known as “Karumia thi” coz the faster you go the more 
                        it hugs the ground.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        15 vehicles had been cleared and serviced over night but two had 
                        failed to start kwa hivo ni Mercedes kumi na tatu zilitoka yard 
                        around saa tatu asubuhi na kwanza kaa kawa tukaandamana na kijana 
                        wa boss hadi petrol station kuweka juice, huyu jamaa had the uncanny 
                        ability ya kukuwekea just enough fuel to get you to Nairobi, the low 
                        fuel light ilikua inawaka ukifika cabanas kwa hivo if ulikua unataka 
                        kupiga roundi zako jiji you had to add more fuel from your own pocket. 
                        There was something nagging me at the back of my mind lakini could not pinpoint it.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Haisuru, sisi hao safari ikaanza, there was a poor apology of a road 
                        from Miritini to Mariakani those days na ukiongezea heavily laden 
                        trucks in the mix you couldnt do more than 40km/hr but after the 
                        weigh bridge it was pedal to the metal, nilifinya kitu nikaskia nimesukumwa 
                        nyuma kwa kiti nikajua baaas, yaani ukikanyanga accelelator gari ina ruka, 
                        it was responding so nicely and very fast, sikua nimedanganywa about hii 
                        beast, I slowed down and fastened my seatbelt na mchezo ukaanza, pia hawa 
                        deree wengine were aware of the vehicle they had and an unofficial race 
                        begun. The only way to overtake them was doing your calculations right, 
                        make split decisions and sometimes you had to overtake on the left, 
                        twathiaga ta marurumi. Ungethania there was a trophy for the first one 
                        to arrive in Nairobi.

                        By Voi I was in second position it was back and 
                        forth between me and this guy Yule sasa niliamini story eti anatumianga 
                        bangi, he was taking crazy suicidal chances and I had to let him go roho 
                        safi, after all I had slices waiting for me in the city and I wanted to arrive in one piece.

                    <p>

                        As usual we were supposed to rendezvous at Mtito lakini juu nilikua 
                        natakufikisha threshold sikusimama (this decision would later haunt me) 
                        nilirusha macho nikaona jamaa wa mabangi amekaria bonnet ya gari yake 
                        smoking I don’t know what, kampigia horni tatu na nikaishia. By saa nane 
                        na nusu nilikua Motherland motors Thika rd nikiweka mbesha kwa wallet, 
                        nikiwa stage nikigoja mat ya Githurai 44 (slices were in Zimmer) ndio 
                        niliona the second merc ikiingia, in half an hour I was in nunuland 
                        happily pumping away hoping to reach the elusive threshold.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Had switched 
                        off my phone coz hawa fellow derees walikua na tabia ya kutorudisha mkono 
                        in the joints we frequented while waiting for the night bus, unanunulia 
                        mtu chupa tatu na ata moja harushi. At 5pm as I waited for my loins to 
                        load again after being drained by this lady wa kutoka kwa kina @vuja-de I 
                        switched on my phone na msgs kaa 50 zikaingia, haiya! I wondered, mbona 
                        natafutwa hivi? Kwani kuna nini? Msg za boss pia zilikua and he is the 
                        first one I called.
                    </p>

                        Kama haujawai ongea na muarabu amekasirika ustake jua ile matusi nilipata, n
                        ikaa alikua anazisoma mahari juu mpaka leo sijaelewa vile waweza tukana mtu 
                        for 5 minutes bila kujirudia, at the end of the tirade ndio nilijua eti 
                        three vehicles, no not vehicles, three Mercedes c230 Kompessor hazikua 
                        zimefika and it was 6pm. Jeeeeeeeeeeso! Suddenly it hit me, 13 cars, 
                        number 13 is unlucky, kumbe hii ndio ilikua inakula akili from morning. 
                        The sperm factory in the scrotum ceased operation immediately mtree 
                        ukashrink na balls zikaingia kwa tumbo.

                <h3 class="story__title">Egerton University Chronicles</h3>
                <p class="story__story">
                    <p>
                        First, some background story. I have been an average student since 
                        primo. I cruised through primo and seco, scoring a B plain pale 
                        mid-90's. Yes, I am that old... (End of background story.)
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        This meant direct entry to University. JAB ferked up big time 
                        coz I was admitted to Egerton to study B. Ed. (Sci). I have 
                        always loved electronics and Computer Science was a very 
                        desirable course for me. Tried seeing VC Prof. Kiptoon 
                        (Vice Chancellor, not Village Chief:D:D:D), but the secretary 
                        could not grant me an appointment with him. I said ***! let me 
                        take Math/ Phy, though I did well in Chem. First year was a 
                        breeze. I had started imbibing Tusker, but it was controlled 
                        consumption. Weekends would find me at Club Dimples, Nakuru.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        This party mood escalated quickly: I became a party animal. 
                        Upon reporting for 2nd year, I discovered I had failed Introduction 
                        to Calculus. The resit was quite easy and this may have fooled me 
                        into thinking that the next units would be as easy. Big mistake!. 
                        By end of Y2S1, I had failed 4 out of 11 units. By end of Y2, I 
                        had failed 9 out of 22 units. I escaped discontinuation by a whisker. 
                        (You had to have failed a total of 50% of credit factors or weighted 
                        average. I was around 49% fail.). I did resits while already in Y3. 
                        I failed 3 units.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Prof. Kiptoon's tenure ended, ushering in Prof. Maritim's era. Upon 
                        inspection of students with F's, he (Maritim) was shocked to find 
                        even 4th years with failed courses. It was the norm then to proceed 
                        to the next year of study with a failed unit. Administration of 
                        resits was erratic at best. Regulations were amended such that in 
                        the event that a student fails a unit, he/ she would first do a 
                        resit, and upon failing the resit, he/ she would retake the course. 
                        If they failed the retake, then it would be an automatic disco. If 
                        one needed to retake the units, he/ she needed to register for them 
                        first. One thus ended up leaving out courses meant for your level. 
                        This meant that you had to come and do them later. I had amassed 4 
                        more F's in Y3, 2 each semester. The courses I had failed in Y3 were 
                        a continuation of Y2 courses.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Wacha depression iingie when I started Y4! Needless to say, I became 
                        a DDO. Kwanza nilianza kunywa hard stuff kama Mountain Bull (similar 
                        to Medusa), then Merry Cane, Tiger and others. Thankfully, suicidal 
                        thoughts never crossed my mind. I didn't get the opportunity to 
                        smoke the hard ones. I am equally thankful that I stayed at my 
                        Aunt's place, who organised counseling sessions for me until I 
                        came to terms with my situation. I went back and cleared the five 
                        Y4 courses I had dropped in favor of Y3 and Y2 ones. During this 
                        time, I tried getting in touch with my friends who had graduated 
                        earlier, lakini once they got to know my number, wakalenga calls 
                        zangu. J & S, Mungu anawaona:D:D:D. Nikasema haina shida, nitamaliza 
                        tu. I finally graduated 3 years later.

                        PS: I stopped imbibing akoho many moons ago and I don't regret 
                        that bit. The exact reason as to why I did it is a story for another day.
